In this tutorial, we will extend the BioNetGen model covered in the [ligand-receptor tutorial](tutorial_lr) to add the phosphorylation chemotaxis mechanisms described in the main text, shown in the figure reproduced below.

To get started, create a copy of your file from the ligand-receptor tutorial and save it as `phosphorylation.bngl`. If you would rather not follow along below, you can download a completed BioNetGen file here:
<a href="../downloads/downloadable/phosphorylation.bngl" download="phosphorylation.bngl">phosphorylation.bngl</a>

## Defining molecules

First, we introduce a state into the receptor and CheY particles to mark whether they are is phosphorylated or not. The notation `Phos~U~P` indicates we introduce phosphorylation states to a molecule (`U` indicates unphosphorylated, and `P` indicates phosphorylated). We also add molecule `CheY(Phos~U~P)` and `CheZ()`. (**Note:** be careful with the use of spaces; don't put spaces after the comma in the specification of the receptor.)

~~~ ruby
begin molecule types
	L(t)             #ligand molecule
	T(l,Phos~U~P)    #receptor complex
	CheY(Phos~U~P)
	CheZ()
end molecule types
~~~

During this simulation, we are interested in tracking the concentration of phosphorylated CheY and CheA (receptor complex) along with the concentration of the ligand.

~~~ ruby
begin observables
	Molecules phosphorylated_CheY CheY(Phos~P)
	Molecules phosphorylated_CheA T(Phos~P)
	Molecules bound_ligand L(t!1).T(l!1)
end observables
~~~

## Defining reactions

Now we are ready to update our reaction rules to include phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in addition to the ligand-receptor reaction. These rules were discussed in the main text and are reproduced below.

~~~ ruby
begin reaction rules
	LigandReceptor: L(t) + T(l) <-> L(t!1).T(l!1) k_lr_bind, k_lr_dis

	#Free vs. ligand-bound complexes autophosphorylates
	FreeTP: T(l,Phos~U) -> T(l,Phos~P) k_T_phos
	BoundTP: L(t!1).T(l!1,Phos~U) -> L(t!1).T(l!1,Phos~P) k_T_phos*0.2

	YP: T(Phos~P) + CheY(Phos~U) -> T(Phos~U) + CheY(Phos~P) k_Y_phos
	YDep: CheZ() + CheY(Phos~P) -> CheZ() + CheY(Phos~U) k_Y_dephos
end reaction rules
~~~

## Initializing molecules and parameters

To initialize our simulation, we need to indicate the number of molecules in *each state* present at the beginning of the simulation. Since we are adding ligands at the beginning of the simulation, the initial amount of molecules at each same state should be equal to the equilibrium concentrations when no ligand is present.  To this end, we set the amount of phosphorylated receptor equal to one-fourth the concentration of unphosphorylated receptor, and the concentration of phosphorylated CheY to be equal to the concentration of unphosphorylated CheY. (Note: this was validated through trial and error.)

~~~ ruby
begin seed species
	L(t) L0
	T(l,Phos~U) T0*0.8
	T(l,Phos~P) T0*0.2
	CheY(Phos~U) CheY0*0.5
	CheY(Phos~P) CheY0*0.5
	CheZ() CheZ0
end seed species
~~~

We now set initial quantities of molecules along with reaction rate parameters to be consistent with *in vivo* quantities [^Li2004][^Spiro1997][^Stock1991].

~~~ ruby
begin parameters
	NaV 6.02e8   #Unit conversion to cellular concentration M/L -> #/um^3
	L0 0        #number of ligand molecules
	T0 7000       #number of receptor complexes
	CheY0 20000
	CheZ0 6000

	k_lr_bind 8.8e6/NaV   #ligand-receptor binding
	k_lr_dis 35           #ligand-receptor dissociation
	k_T_phos 15           #receptor complex autophosphorylation
	k_Y_phos 3.8e6/NaV    #receptor complex phosphorylates CheY
	k_Y_dephos 8.6e5/NaV  #Z dephosphoryaltes CheY
end parameters
~~~

**Important note:** The `parameters` section has to appear before the `reaction rules` section.

Place everything occurring above between `begin model` and `end model` tags.

## Simulating responses to attractants

Before running the simulation, let's think about what will happen. If we don't add any ligand molecule into the system, then assuming that we have started the simulation at steady-state, then the concentrations of phosphorylated receptors and CheY will remain at equilibrium.

We can now run the simulation, setting `t_end` equal to 3 in order to run the simulation for longer than we did in the ligand-receptor tutorial. Place the following after `end model` in your BioNetGen file.

~~~ ruby
	generate_network({overwrite=>1})
	simulate({method=>"ssa", t_end=>3, n_steps=>100})
~~~

end model

generate_network({overwrite=>1})
simulate({method=>"ssa", t_end=>3, n_steps=>100})

Now save your file and run the simulation by clicking `Run` under `Simulate`. What do you observe?

When we add ligand molecules into the system, as we did in the tutorial for [ligand-receptor dynamics](tutorial_lr), the concentration of bound receptors should increase. What will happen to the concentration of phosphorylated CheA, and phosphorylated CheY? What will happen to steady state concentrations?

Now run your simulation by changing `L0` to be equal to 5000 and then run it again with `L0` to be equal to 1e5. Do the results confirm your hypothesis? What happens as we keep changing `L0`? What happens as `L0` gets really large (e.g., 1e9)? What do you think is going on?

In the main text, we will explore the results of the above simulation. We will then interpret how differences in the amounts of initial ligand can influence changes in the concentration of phosphorylated CheY (and therefore the bacterium's tumbling frequency).
