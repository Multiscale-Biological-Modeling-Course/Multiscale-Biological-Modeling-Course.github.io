## Options other than run-and-tumble?

Run-and-tumble is the most studied mechanism of bacterial chemotaxis strategy. However, microorganisms have different sizes, shapes, evolutionary histories, metabolisms, and live in a very diverse range of environments. When we shift our focus to other microorganisms in other environments, run-and-tumble may not be optimal, and many other strategies exist [^Mitchell2006].

**Exercise:** What would work better for the organism if: the organism is very small even compared to an *E. coli*; the organism moves extremely slowly; the organisms could sense the gradient along its body?

The (f) strategy above is called helical klinotaxis, and is often used by larger aquatic microorganisms. One example is dinoflagellates, a single-celled eukaryote found in marine or freshwater habitats (also responsible for the bioluminescent waves at San Diego). Dinoflagellates move along the helical trajectories, while the net direction of movement is along the increasing concentration of attractants. As illustarted in the figure, the rotation of the trailing flagelli produces an angular velocity ω<sub>1</sub>, and the rotation of the transversal flagelli produces an angular velocity ω<sub>2</sub>. The net direction of the trajectory is determined by ω<sub>1</sub>/ω<sub>2</sub>.
