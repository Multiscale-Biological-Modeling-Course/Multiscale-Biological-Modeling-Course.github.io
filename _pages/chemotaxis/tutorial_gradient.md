In the [previous tutorial](tutorial_adaptation), we modeled how bacteria react and adapt to a one-time addition of attractants. In real life, bacteria don't suddenly drop into an environment with more attractants; instead, they explore a variable environment. In this tutorial, we will adapt our model to simulate a bacterium as it travels up an exponentially increasing concentration gradient.

We will also explore defining and using **functions**, a feature of BioNetGen that will allow us to specify reaction rules in which the reaction rates are dependent on the current state of the system.

To get started, create a copy of your `adaptation.bngl` file from the adaptation tutorial and save it as `addition.bngl`. If you would rather not follow along below, you can download a completed BioNetGen file here: <a href="../downloads/downloadable/addition.bngl" download="addition.bngl">addition.bngl</a>

We also will build a Jupyter notebook in this tutorial for plotting the concentrations of molecules over time. You should create a file called `plotter_up.ipynb`; if you would rather not follow along, we provide a completed notebook here:
<a href="../downloads/downloadable/plotter_up.ipynb" download="plotter_up.ipynb">plotter_up.ipynb</a>

## Modeling an increasing ligand gradient with a BioNetGen function

Our BioNetGen model will largely stay the same, except for the fact that we are changing the concentration of ligand over time. To model an increasing concentration of ligand corresponding to a bacterium moving up an attractant gradient, we will increase the background ligand concentration at an exponential rate.

We will simulate an increase in attractant concentration by using a "dummy reaction" *L* â†’ 2*L* in which one ligand molecule becomes two. To do so, we will add the following reaction to the `reaction rules` section.

As we have observed earlier in this module, when the ligand concentration is very high, receptors are saturated, and the cell can no longer detect a change in ligand concentration. If you explored the [adaptation simulation](tutorial_adap), then you saw that this occurs after *l*<sub>0</sub> passes `1e8`; we will therefore cap the allowable ligand concentration at this value.

We can cap our ligand concentration by defining the rate of the dummy reaction using a function `add_Rate()`. This function requires another observable, `AllLigand`. By adding the line `Molecules AllLigand L` in the `observables` section, `AllLigand` will record the total concentration of ligand in the system at each time step (both bound and unbound). As for our reaction, if `AllLigand` is less than `1e8`, then the dummy reaction should take place at some given rate `k_add`. Otherwise, `AllLigand` exceeds`1e8`, and we will set the rate of the dummy reaction to zero. This can be achieved with a `functions` section in BioNetGen using the following `if` statement to branch based on the value of `AllLigand`.

**Important note:** Please ensure that the `functions` section occurs before the `reaction rules` section in your BioNetGen file.

~~~ ruby
begin functions
	addRate() = if(AllLigand>1e8,0,k_add)
end functions
~~~

Now we are ready to add our dummy reaction to the `reaction rules` section with a reaction rate of `addRate()`.

~~~ ruby
#Simulate an exponentially increasing gradient using a dummy reaction
LAdd: L(t) -> L(t) + L(t) addRate()
~~~

Now that we have defined our dummy reaction, we should specify the default rate of this reaction `k_add` in the `parameters` section. We first will try a value of `k_add` of 0.1/s with an initial ligand concentration `L0` of `1e4`. This means that the model is simulating a gradient of d[*L*]/dt = 0.1[*L*]. If `L0` is `1e4`, then the solution to this differential equation is [L] = 1000e<sup>0.1<em>t</em></sup> molecules per second.

~~~ ruby
k_add 0.1
L0 1e4
~~~

## Running our updated BioNetGen model

Save your file, then go to `simulation` and click `Run`. What happens to the concentration of phosphorylated CheY? (**Note:** you can deselect `AllLigand` to make the plot of the concentration of phosphorylated CheY easier to see.)

Try the following few different values for `k_add`: 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5. What do these changing `k_add` values represent in the simulation? How does the system respond to the different values?

All of your simulation results are stored in the `RuleBender-workspace/PROJECT_NAME/results/MODEL_NAME/TIME/` directory in your computer. Rename the directory with the `k_add` values instead of the time of running for simplicity.

You will observe that CheY phosphorylation drops gradually first, instead of the instantaneous sharp drop as we add lots of ligand at once. That means, with the ligand concentration increases, the cell is able to continuously lower the tumbling frequency.

## Visualizing the results of our simulation

We are now ready to fill in `plotter_up.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook that we will use to visualize the outcome of our simulations.

First specify the directories, model name, species of interest, and rates. Put the `RuleBender-workspace/PROJECT_NAME/results/MODEL_NAME/` folder inside the same directory as `plotter_up.ipynb` or change the `model_path` below to point at this folder.

~~~ python
#Specify the data to plot here.
model_path = "addition"  #The folder containing the model
model_name = "addition"  #Name of the model
target = "phosphorylated_CheY"    #Target molecule
vals = [0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5]  #Gradients of interest
~~~

We next provide some import statements for needed dependencies.

~~~ python
import numpy as np
import sys
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import colorspace
~~~

To compare the responses for different gradients, we color-code each gradient. [Colorspace](https://python-colorspace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hclcolorspace.html) is one of the straight-forward ways to set up a color palette. Here we use a qualitative palette with hues (`h`) equally spaced between `[0, 300]`, and constant chroma (`c`) and luminance (`l`) values.

~~~ python
#Define the colors to use
colors = colorspace.qualitative_hcl(h=[0, 300.], c = 60, l = 70, pallete = "dynamic")(len(vals))
~~~

The following function loads and parses the data. Once the file containing your data is loaded, we use the first row to investigate which column stores the concentration of the "target" observable species of interest. When we find that target, we will then access the time points and concentrations of this target molecule.

~~~ python
def load_data(val):
    file_path = os.path.join(model_path, str(val), model_name + ".gdat")
    with open(file_path) as f:
        first_line = f.readline() #Read the first line
    cols = first_line.split()[1:] #Get the col names (species names)

    ind = 0
    while cols[ind] != target:
        ind += 1                  #Get col number of target molecule

    data = np.loadtxt(file_path)  #Load the file
    time = data[:, 0]             #Time points
    concentration = data[:, ind]  #Concentrations

    return time, concentration
~~~

Now we will write a function to plot the time coordinates on the *x*-axis and the concentrations of the molecule at these time points on the *y*-axis. To do so, we will use the [Matplotlib plot](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.2/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot.html) function to plot concentrations through time for each gradient value. Time-series data will be colored by the color palette we mentioned earlier.

~~~ python
def plot(val, time, concentration, ax, i):
    legend = "k = " + str(val)
    ax.plot(time, concentration, label = legend, color = colors[i])
    ax.legend()

    return
~~~

The plotting function above needs to be initialized with a figure defined by the [subplot](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.2/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html) function. We loop through every gradient concentration to perform the plotting. Afterward, we define labels for the *x*-axis and *y*-axis, figure title, and tick lines. The call to `plt.show()` displays the plot.

~~~ python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize = (10, 8))
for i in range(len(vals)):
    val = vals[i]
    time, concentration = load_data(val)
    plot(val, time, concentration, ax, i)

plt.xlabel("time (s)")
plt.ylabel("concentration (#molecules)")
plt.title("Phosphorylated CheY vs time")
ax.minorticks_on()
ax.grid(b = True, which = 'minor', axis = 'both', color = 'lightgrey', linewidth = 0.5, linestyle = ':')
ax.grid(b = True, which = 'major', axis = 'both', color = 'grey', linewidth = 0.8 , linestyle = ':')

plt.show()
~~~

Now run the notebook. How do changing values of `k_add` impact the CheY-P concentrations? Why do you think this is?

In the main text, we will examine the results of our plots and discuss how they can be used to infer the cell's behavior in the presence of increasing attractant.
