In this tutorial, we will use CellBlender to run a (mathematically controlled) comparison of simple regulation against regulation via the type-1 incoherent feed-forward loop that we saw in the main text.

Load your `CellBlender_Tutorial_Template.blend` file from the [Random Walk Tutorial](../prologue/tutorial-random-walk). Save your file as `ffl.blend`. You may also download the completed tutorial file <a href="../tutorials/incoher_ffl.blend" download="incoher_ffl.blend">here</a>.

Go to `CellBlender > Molecules` and create the following molecules:

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm1.png){: .align-center}

1. Click on the `+` button.
2. Select a color (such as white).
3. Name the molecule `X1`.
4. Select the molecule type as `Surface Molecule`.
5. Add a diffusion constant of `1e-6`.
6. Up the scale factor to `5` (click and type “5” or use the arrows).

Repeat the above steps to make sure that the following molecules are entered with the appropriate parameters.

| Molecule Name | Molecule Type|Diffusion Constant| Scale Factor|
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| X1  | Surface  | 1e-6  | 5|
| Z1  | Surface  | 1e-6  | 1|
| X2  | Surface  | 1e-6  | 5|
| Y2  | Surface  | 1e-6  | 1|
| Z2  | Surface  | 1e-6  | 1|

Now go to `CellBlender > Molecule Placement` to set the following release sites for our molecules:

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm3.png){: .align-center}

1. Click on the `+` button.
2. Select or type in the molecule `X1`.
3. Type in the name of the Object/Region `Plane`.
4. Set the Quantity to Release as `300`.

Repeat the above steps to make sure all of the following molecule release sites are entered.

| Molecule Name | Object/Region|Quantity to Release|
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| X1  | Plane | 300 |
| X2  | Plane | 300 |

Next go to `CellBlender > Reactions` to create the following reactions:

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm4.png){: .align-center}

1. Click on the `+` button.
2. Under reactants, type `X1’` (note the apostrophe).
3. Under products, type `X1’ + Z1’`.
4. Set the forward rate as `4e2`.

Repeat the above steps for the following reactions.

| Reactants |Products|Forward Rate|
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| X1’  | X1’ + Z1’ | 4e2 |
| Z1’  | NULL | 4e2 |
| X2’  | X2’ + Y2’ | 2e2 |
| X2’  | X2’ + Z2’ | 4e3 |
|Y2’ + Z2’| Y2’|4e2|
| Y2’  | NULL | 4e2 |
| Z2’  | NULL | 4e2 |

Go to `CellBlender > Plot Output Settings` to set up a plot as follows:

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm6.png){: .align-center}

1. Click on the `+` button.
2. Set the molecule name as `Z1`.
3. Ensure `World` is selected.
4. Ensure `Java Plotter` is selected.
5. Ensure `One Page, Multiple Plots` is selected.
6. Ensure `Molecule Colors` is selected.

Repeat the above steps to ensure that we plot all of the following molecules.

| Molecule Name|Selected Region|
|:--------|:-------:|
| Z1| World|
| Z2| World|

We are now ready to run our simulation. Go to `CellBlender > Run Simulation` and select the following options:

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm7.png){: .align-center}

1. Set the number of iterations to `12000`.
2. Ensure the time step is set as `1e-6`.
3. Click `Export & Run`.

Once the simulation has run, we can visualize our data with `CellBlender > Reload Visualization Data`.

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm8.png){: .align-center}

If you like, you can watch the animation within the Blender window by clicking the play button at the bottom of the screen.

Now go back to `CellBlender > Plot Output Settings` and scroll to the bottom to click “Plot”. This will produce a plot of the amount of *Z* under simple regulation compared to the amount of *Z* for the feed-forward loop. Is it what you expected?

Save your file, and then use the link below to return to the main text, where we will interpret the outcome of our simulation.
