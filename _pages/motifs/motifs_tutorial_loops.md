In this tutorial, we will build a Jupyter Notebook to analyze loops in the *E. coli* transcription factor network, which can be downloaded <a href="../downloads/network_tf_tf_clean.txt" download="network_tf_tf_clean.txt">here</a>. If you would like to jump to the end of the analysis, you can download the complete Jupyter Notebook <a href="../downloads/Network_Demo.ipynb" download="Network_Demo.ipynb">here</a>.

You will also need the following helper file:
<a href="https://purpleavatar.github.io/multiscale_biological_modeling/downloads/network_loader.py" download="network_loader.py">Python File</a>

Before running this tutorial, make sure that the following software and packages are installed. **Warning:** Be careful of the igraph installation and follow the website instructions carefully. When installing via pip or conda, specify "*python-igraph*" instead of "*igraph*".

| Installation Link | Version[^version] | Check Install |
|:------|:-----:|------:|
| [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  |3.7 |*python --version* |
| [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) | 4.4.0 | *jupyter --version* |
| [python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/install.html) | 0.8.0 | *conda list* or *pip list* |

[^version]: Other versions may be compatible with this code, but those listed are known to work for this tutorial.

Create a blank Jupiter notebook titled `loops.ipynb` and start editing this file below. First, we import the transcription factor network and see how many nodes and edges there are, as well as count the number of loops.

~~~ python
# NOTE: when installing via pip or conda, install python-igraph
from igraph import *
from network_loader import *
import random

txt_file = 'network_tf_tf_clean.txt'

network, vertex_names = open_network(txt_file)

# how many nodes & edges
print("Number of nodes: ", len(network.vs))
print("Number of edges: ", len(network.es))
print("Number of self-loops: ", sum(Graph.is_loop(network)))
~~~

If you run your notebook, you should obtain the following statistics.

* Number of nodes:  197
* Number of edges:  477
* Number of self-loops:  130

We can also create a visualization of the network by adding the following line of code to our network.

~~~ python
plot(network, vertex_label=vertex_names, vertex_label_size=8,
     edge_arrow_width=1, edge_arrow_size=0.5, autocurve=True)
~~~

Running the notebook now produces the following network.

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_finding_ecoli_2.png){: .align-center}

Our plan is to compare this network against a random network. The following code will call a function from a package to generate a random network with 197 nodes and 477 edges and plot it. It uses a built in function called `random.seed()` that takes an integer as input and uses this function to initiate a (pseudo)random number generator that will allow us to generate a random network.  There is nothing special about the input value 42 here -- or is there?

~~~ python
random.seed(42)
g = Graph.Erdos_Renyi(197,m=477,directed=True, loops=True)
plot(g, edge_arrow_width=1, edge_arrow_size=0.5, autocurve=True)
~~~

The resulting network is shown in the figure below.

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_finding_random.png){: .align-center}

The question is how many edges and self-loops this network has, which is handled by the following code.

~~~ python
# how many nodes & edges
print("Number of nodes: ", len(g.vs))
print("Number of edges: ", len(g.es))
print("Number of self-loops: ", sum(Graph.is_loop(g)))
~~~

This code produces the following statistics for the random network.

* Number of nodes:  197
* Number of edges:  477
* Number of self-loops:  5

The number of self-loops is significantly lower in the random network compared to the real transcription factor network.

**STOP:** Change the input integer to ``random.seed`` to any integer you like. How does it affect the number of nodes, edges, and self-loops? Try changing the input to a few different values.
{: .notice--primary}

Regardless of what seed value we use, we can confirm that the number of self-loops expected in a random graph is significantly lower than in the real *E. coli* network. Back in the main text, we will discuss this significance and then see if we can determine why autoregulation has arisen.
