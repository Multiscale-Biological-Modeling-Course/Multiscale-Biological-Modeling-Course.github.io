## Exercises

* Make a cell update an exercise at end.

* Good exercise on changing the diffusion rates outside of what is specified by Gray-Scott.

* Good questions below. May need to be exercises.

* Visiting Robert P. Munafo https://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/index.html simulations and matching some more up to our Jupyter Notebook simulations

* The Gray-Scott reactions always seem to reach a steady state where the simulation stops moving. Are you able to find parameters or predator placement which creates an oscillatory pattern?

* Play with the seed_size in the Gray-Scott jupyter notebook. What does this parameter control?

**STOP**: Is it ever possible for a square to have a concentration greater than 1? Why or why not?
{: .notice--primary}

**STOP**: Note that the concentrations of all of the particles add up to 1 in each step. Do you think that this must always be true?
