Load the `CellBlender_Tutorial_Template.blend` file that you generated in the [Random Walk Tutorial](tutorial-random-walk). You may also download the complete file <a href="../tutorials/CellBlender_Tutorial_Template.blend" download="CellBlender_Tutorial_Template.blend">here</a>. Save this file as a new file named `turing_pattern.blend`. The completed tutorial is also available <a href="../tutorials/turing_pattern.blend" download="turing_pattern.blend">here</a>.

We will first visit `CellBlender > Molecules` and create the *B* molecules, as shown in the screenshot below.

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm1.png){: .align-center}

1. Click on the `+` button.
2. Select a color (such as red).
3. Name the molecule `B`.
4. Under `molecule type`, select `surface molecule`.
5. Add a diffusion constant of `3e-6`. The diffusion constant indicates how many units to move the particle every time unit. (We will specify the time unit below at runtime.)
6. Up the scale factor to `2` (click and type `2` or use the arrows).

Then, repeat the above steps to make sure that all of the following molecules are entered. We use a molecule named `Hidden` to represent a "hidden" molecule that will be used to generate `A` molecules.

| Molecule Name | Molecule Type | Color | Diffusion Constant| Scale Factor|
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| B  | Surface | Red | 3e-6  | 3|
| A  | Surface  | Green | 6e-6  | 3 |
| Hidden  | Surface  | Blue | 1e-6  | 0 |

Now visit `CellBlender > Molecule Placement` to set the following sites for releasing molecules of each of the three types. First, we will release the hidden molecules across the region so that any new *A* particles will be produced uniformly.

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm3.png){: .align-center}

1. Click on the `+` button.
2. Select or type in the molecule `Hidden`.
3. Type in the name of the Object/Region `Plane`.
4. Set the Quantity to Release as `1000`.

Then, repeat the above steps to release an initial quantity of *A* molecules as well, using the following table.

| Molecule Name | Object/Region|Quantity to Release|
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| Hidden  | Plane | 1000 |
| A | Plane | 6000 |

We are going to release an initial collection of *B* particles in a cluster in the center of the plane. To do so, we will need a very specific initial release of these particles, and so we will not be able to use the `Molecule Placement` tab. For this reason, we need to write a Python script to place these molecules, shown below. (Don't worry if you are not comfortable with Python.)

~~~ python
   import cellblender as cb
   dm = cb.get_data_model()
   mcell = dm['mcell']
   rels = mcell['release_sites']
   rlist = rels['release_site_list']
   point_list = []
   for x in range(10):
     for y in range(10):
         point_list.append([x/100,y/100,0.0])
   for x in range(10):
     for y in range(10):
         point_list.append([x/100 - 0.5,y/100 - 0.5,0.0])
   for x in range(10):
     for y in range(10):
         point_list.append([x/100 - 0.8,y/100,0.0])
   for x in range(10):
     for y in range(10):
         point_list.append([x/100 + 0.8,y/100 - 0.8,0.0])
   new_rel = {
     'data_model_version' : "DM_2015_11_11_1717",
     'location_x' : "0",
     'location_y' : "0",
     'location_z' : "0",
     'molecule' : "B",
     'name' : "pred_rel",
     'object_expr' : "arena",
     'orient' : "'",
     'pattern' : "",
     'points_list' : point_list,
     'quantity' : "400",
     'quantity_type' : "NUMBER_TO_RELEASE",
     'release_probability' : "1",
     'shape' : "LIST",
     'site_diameter' : "0.01",
     'stddev' : "0"
   }
   rlist.append ( new_rel )
   cb.replace_data_model ( dm )
~~~

Locate the `Outliner` pane on the top-right of the Blender screen. On the left of the view button in the Outliner pane, there is a code tree icon.

Click on this icon and choose `Text Editor`. To create a new file for our code, click the `+` button. Copy and paste the code into the text editor and save it with the name `pred-center.py`.

Next visit `CellBlender > Scripting > Data-Model Scripting > Run Script`, as shown in the following screenshot. Select `Internal` from the Data-Model Scripting menu and click the refresh button. Click on the filename entry area next to `File` and enter `pred_center.py`. Click on `Run Script` to execute

![image-center](../assets/images/outliner_script.PNG){: .align-center}

You should see that another placement site called `pred_rel` has appeared in the `Molecule Placement` tab.

Next go to `CellBlender > Reactions` to create the reactions that will drive the system.

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm4.png){: .align-center}

1. Click on the `+` button.
2. Under reactants, type `Hidden;` (**note:** the semi-colon is important).
3. Under products, type `Hidden; + A;`
4. Set the forward rate as `1e5`.

Repeat these steps to ensure that we have all of the following reactions.

| Reactants |Products|Forward Rate|
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| Hidden;  | Hidden; + A; | 1e5 |
| B;  | NULL | 1e5 |
| B; + B; + A;  | B; + B; + B; | 1e1 |

We are now ready to run our simulation. To do so, visit `CellBlender > Run Simulation` and select the following options:

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm7.png){: .align-center}

1. Set the number of iterations to `200`.
2. Ensure the time step is set as `1e-6`.
3. Click `Export & Run`.

Once the run is complete, save your file.

We can also now visualize our simulation. Click on `CellBlender > Reload Visualization Data`. You have the option of watching the animation within the Blender window by clicking the play button at the bottom of the screen.

![image-center](../assets/images/motifs_norm8.png){: .align-center}

If you like, you can export this animation by using the following steps:

![image-center](../assets/images/cellblender_render.png){: .align-center}

1. Click on the `movie` tab.
2. Scroll down to the file name.
3. Select a suitable location for the file.
4. Select the file type you would like (we suggest FFmpeg_video).
5. Click on `Render > OpenGL Render Animation`.

The movie will begin playing, and when the animation is complete, the movie file should be in the folder location you selected.

You may be wondering how the parameters in the above simulations were chosen. The fact of the matter is that for many choices of these parameters, we will obtain behavior that does not produce an animation as interesting as what we found in this tutorial. Furthermore, try making slight changes to the feed and kill rates in the CellBlender reactions (e.g., multiplying one of them by 1.25) and watching the animation. How does a small change in parameters cause the animation to change?

As we return to the main text, we will discuss how the patterns that we observe change as we make slight changes to these parameters. What biological conclusion can we draw from this phenomenon?
