Quantum physics tells us that everything that happens in the universe ultimately depends on the interaction of tiny particles.  Yet it is difficult for beings like ourselves to acknowledge this fundamental truth of the universe when our experience of existence is guided by "macro" phenomena.

Although you seem like a coherent, single being, you are nothing more than a skin-covered bag of trillions of cells acting largely independently. Over half of these cells aren't even yours! They correspond to bacteria that make up a couple of kilograms of your mass.

Every memory you have ever had, however powerful, can be encoded by a particular exchange of ions across neural synapses deep within your nervous system.  Even the behavior of an individual cell within you is driven almost chiefly by the action of molecules that sense their environment and cause chemical reactions within the cell to evince what we see as a cellular change.

This perspective on your existence may seem desparately cold, but its purpose is to enforce the point that we are all already used to inferring high-level behavior from a symphony of much more low-level processes that are invisible to us. Yet what makes the whole affair seem even crueler is that this symphony is often based upon *randomness*. Not only is there no sentient being driving the molecular interactions in our cells, but these interactions rely upon interactions fueled by the random movement of particles.

Throughout this course, we will attempt to make high-level inferences about biological systems by building simple models of these systems that often include randomness as a key feature of the model. We will see that even though a system is driven by randomness and simple rules does not mean that it does not have emergent behavior that is sophisticated, even beautiful.

We hope that you will join us for this course, which is divided into five modules that cover different aspects of biological modeling. By clicking "next lesson" below, you can continue reading the prologue, a shorter module that serves as a warmup to this course. It starts with an innocent enough question: "how did the zebra get its stripes?"
