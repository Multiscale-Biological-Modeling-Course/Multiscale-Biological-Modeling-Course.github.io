        <p class="title">Project Founder and Lead</p>
        <p markdown="1"> Phillip Compeau is an Associate Teaching Professor and the Assistant Department Head for Education in the [Computational Biology Department](http://cbd.cmu.edu) in Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. He directs the [undergraduate program in computational biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/education/bs-in-computational-biology/), co-directs the [Precollege Program in Computational Biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/education/pre-college-program-in-computational-biology/), and serves as Assistant Director of the [Master's in Computational Biology program](http://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/).

Phillip is passionate about open online education, and his education projects have reached hundreds of thousands of learners around the world. He is the co-author of [Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.org), which has been adopted in over 140 institutions around the world. This textbook powers the popular [Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics). He co-founded the learning platform [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info) for learning programming, bioinformatics, and algorithms through independent problem solving.  Finally, Phillip is the founder of [Programming for Lovers](http://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu/programming-for-lovers/), an online course in introductory programming motivated by fun scientific applications.</p>

        <p class="title">Web Designer &amp; Content Developer</p>
        <p markdown="1">Noah Yann Lee is a PhD student at Yale University under the Computational Biology and Bioinfornatics program. Noah completed his undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, graduating in 2020 with a B.S. in Computational Biology with a minor in [Design for Learning](https://ideate.cmu.edu/undergraduate-programs/learning-media/index.html). From running early-childhood educational tests with the Children's School at Carnegie Mellon for the [Global Learning XPRIZE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/robotutor/), to cultivating and sequencing phage genomes with the PhageHunters program, Noah has an appreciation for science from the micro to the macro, physical to the digital. Noah is always interested to connect with projects and organizations working with STEM, education, and science outreach</p>
