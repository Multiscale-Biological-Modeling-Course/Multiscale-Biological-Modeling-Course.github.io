        <h2>Phillip Compeau</h2>
        <p class="title">Founder and Director</p>
        <p markdown="1"> Phillip Compeau is a Teaching Professor of Computational Biology and the Assistant Dean for Innovation in Computing Education in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He directs the [undergraduate program in computational biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/education/bs-in-computational-biology/) and co-directs the [Precollege Program in Computational Biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/education/pre-college-program-in-computational-biology/), both of which he co-founded.

Phillip is passionate about open online education, and his education projects have reached hundreds of thousands of learners around the world. He is the co-author of [Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.org), which has been adopted by 200 instructors in 40 countries, and which powers the popular [Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics). He co-founded the learning platform [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info) for learning programming, bioinformatics, and algorithms through independent problem solving. He founded [Programming for Lovers](http://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu/programming-for-lovers/), an online course in introductory programming motivated by fun scientific applications.</p>

        <p class="title">Web Designer &amp; Content Developer</p>
        <p markdown="1">Noah Yann Lee is a PhD student at Yale University under the Computational Biology and Bioinfornatics program. Noah completed his undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, graduating in 2020 with a B.S. in Computational Biology with a minor in [Design for Learning](https://ideate.cmu.edu/undergraduate-programs/learning-media/index.html). From running early-childhood educational tests with the Children's School at Carnegie Mellon for the [Global Learning XPRIZE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/robotutor/), to cultivating and sequencing phage genomes with the PhageHunters program, Noah has an appreciation for science from the micro to the macro, physical to the digital. Noah is always interested to connect with projects and organizations working with STEM, education, and science outreach.</p>

This online course is a training and dissemination effort for the <a href="https://mmbios.pitt.edu" target="_blank">National Center for Multiscale Modeling of Biological Systems (MMBioS)</a>. It is supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant ID: P41 GM103712).

We would first and foremost like to thank everyone working on MMBioS software; their work allowed this project to come about. Chiefly, thank you to the other members of our training and dissemination team (Alex Ropelewski, Joe Ayoob, and Rozita Laghaei) as well as the head of the MMBioS consortium, Jim Faeder.

We are also very grateful to Wendy Velasquez Ebanks, Julien Gomez, Yanjing Li, Ulani Qi, Aditya Parekh, and Shalini Panthangi, who provided additional work on the course during its conception.

Module 1 was in part inspired by Uri Alon's research and superlative book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Systems-Biology-Mathematical-Computational/dp/1439837171" target="_blank"><i>An Introduction to Systems Biology</i></a>, a landmark biological textbook that we strongly recommend if you are interested in a greater discussion of biological network motifs.

Special thanks to Jiayi Shou for the analogy in Module 3 of new protein companies rising like "bamboo shoots after the rain".

The cover image on Module 4 was created by Keith Chambers.

Finally, the website design was built using Michael Rose's excellent <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes</a> theme.
