### Step 5 Classification

To convert our current PCA pipeline coordinates to a format to be used in Weka, we need to convert our `WBC_PCA.csv` file into the `arff` format used by Weka.

### Method 1: Weka for File Conversion

Open Weka and navigate to `Tools --> ArffViewer`.

Then navigate to `File --> Open`.

Change the `Files of Type` option to `CSV data files`.

Find the `WBC_PCA.csv` file in your `Step4_ShapeSpaceVisualization` folder and click `Open`.

Once all the data is loaded on screen, navigate to `File --> Save as â€¦`.

Locate the `Step5_Classification` folder, remove the `.csv` extension in the `File Name` field, and click `Save`.

As a result, our PCA pipeline coordinates have now been converted to the file format that Weka accepts for further classification. This file should be saved as `WBC_PCA.arff` in the `Step5_Classification` subfolder of the `WBC_CellClass` folder.
