### Installing Weka

In this tutorial, we will apply the k-NN classifier to the post-PCA shape space of WBC nuclei images that we generated in the [previous tutorial](tutorial_shape_space). To do so, we will need a statistical software framework that includes classification algorithms. There are a number of popular platforms available, but we will choose <a href="https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/" target="_blank">Weka</a>, developed at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, since it is relatively light-weight and easy to get running quickly.

To install Weka, follow the instructions provided at the <a href="https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/" target="_blank">Weka wiki</a>.

### Converting a shape space file

To convert our current PCA pipeline coordinates to a format to be used in Weka, we need to convert the `WBC_PCA.csv` file that we produced in the previous tutorial and that contains the coordinates of every image in the post-PCA shape space into the `arff` format used by Weka. If you have not completed the previous tutorial, or you would like to skip to the next section of this tutorial, we provide the completed file for download <a href="../downloads/WBC_PCA.arff">here</a>.

Open Weka and navigate to `Tools --> ArffViewer`.

Then navigate to `File --> Open`.

Change the `Files of Type` option to `CSV data files`.

Find the `WBC_PCA.csv` file in your `Step4_Visualization` folder and click `Open`.

[![image-center](../assets/images/600px/cellorg_step_5.png){: .align-center}](../assets/images/cellorg_step_5.png)

Once all the data is loaded on screen, navigate to `File --> Save as â€¦`.

[![image-center](../assets/images/600px/cellorg_step_6.png){: .align-center}](../assets/images/cellorg_step_6.png)

Remove the `.csv` extension in the `File Name` field, and click `Save`.

[![image-center](../assets/images/600px/cellorg_step_7.png){: .align-center}](../assets/images/cellorg_step_7.png)

As a result, our PCA pipeline coordinates have now been converted to the file format that Weka accepts for further classification. This file should be saved as `WBC_PCA.arff` in the `Step4_Visualization` subfolder of the `WBC_CellClass` folder.

Now that we have the PCA dataset in the correct format, click `Exit` to return to the Weka home screen.

###

You should now be at the `Weka GUI Chooser` window that shows at the application's startup. Under `Applications`, click `Explorer` to bring up the `Weka Explorer` window. This is the main window that we will use to run our classifier.

* We will lose some information present in the original data, but the more structure that is present in the data, the less information that we will lose. -- something about the percentage of variation in the data that can be explained by the multiple dimensions?
