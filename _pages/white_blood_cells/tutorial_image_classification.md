### Step 5 Classification

To convert our current PCA pipeline coordinates to a format to be used in Weka, we need to convert our WBC_PCA.csv file into arff format.

Method 1: Weka for File Conversion

Open Weka.
Navigate to Tools --> ArffViewer.

Navigate to File --> Open
![image-center](../assets/images/cellorg_step_3.png){: .align-center}
Change the Files of Type option to CSV data files.

Locate the WBC_PCA.csv file in the Step4_ShapeSpaceVisualization folder and press Open.
![image-center](../assets/images/cellorg_step_5.png){: .align-center}
Once all the data is loaded on screen, navigate to File --> Save as â€¦ .

Locate the Step5_Classification folder, remove the .csv extension in the File Name field and press Save.

As a result, our PCA pipeline coordinates have now been converted to the file format that Weka accepts for further classification. This file should be saved as WBC_PCA.arff in the Step5_Classification subfolder of the WBC_CellClass folder.
