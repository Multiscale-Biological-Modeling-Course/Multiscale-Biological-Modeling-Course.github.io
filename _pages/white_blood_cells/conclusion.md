A professor's phone never rings. And yet here was the phone in my office, on a cold spring afternoon, ringing away. "Nothing good can come of this", I thought. Nervously, I answered.

On the other end of the line was a local dermatologist. He asked me if I knew of anyone working on diagnosing cancer from images of skin lesions. He had noticed that he and his colleagues weren't very accurate at this task when they compared their initial impressions against a biopsy.

I told him that I was unaware of any colleagues working on such a project, but an internet search took me to an article (CITE) that had recently attained a landmark result and has since been cited thousands of times. This article devised an algorithm that beat 21 certified U.S. dermatologists at classifying images of skin lesions into one of three classes: **malignant** (i.e., cancerous and at risk of spread), **benign** (a non-cancerous tumor with no risk of spread), and **non-neoplastic** (not a tumor).

As is the case for the skin lesion research, the currently best known classifier for WBC image classification (CITE) uses a technique called **deep learning**. You may have seen this term wielded with mystical reverence, but you may very well not know what it means; let's take a moment to explain it.

## A brief introduction to neural networks

* Explain what an artificial neuron is: cite McCullough-Pitts and perceptrons

* Most general form of network -- explain the parameters in the network.

* Convert input into a vector, and output should fall into classes.

* This is what we would hope would happen, but it means finding the "best" collection of parameters for the network.

## Finding the best choice of parameters

## Exploring a parameter space

## A reflection on deep learning

## Other

* We have been doing ML all along --- meme with cake?



## Deep learning and the state of the art for WBC classification

* I bet you feel a bit better about our results on WBC nuclear image analysis! So the approach does improve over a human, but we aren't any good at solving this problem either. This is the ultimate hope of machine learning algorithms --- that they not just beat us, but they do so in resounding fashion.

## Wrapping up

* That's it! Thank you for joining us in this text. If you're reading this, we are very grateful that you made it all the way through.

* Point to exercises
