Exercise: Say that we have identified the locations of the following three points.
x = (-8, 1)
y = (7, 6)
z = (10, -2)

If the distances to some point w with unknown location are:
d(x, w) = 13
d(y, w) = 3
d(z, w) = 10
 then where is w?

 Answer: (4, 6).


Exercise idea: local search and parameter estimation -- tie back to previous modules.

Exercise idea: soft classification, and breaking ties.

Exercise idea: show that RMSD of two vectors of length n is equivalent to Euclidean distance of two vectors of length 2n.

Exercise idea: PCA vs. linear regression for a few different data points to see that the resulting lines are different.
