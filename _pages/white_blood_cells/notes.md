* Insert visual of plane through three-d data. Great idea would be to use real iris data and show the resulting two-dimensional space.

* Possibly visualize PCA applied to shape space when we build it? Add this to the end of the pca lesson.

* We will lose some information present in the original data, but the more structure that is present in the data, the less information that we will lose. -- something about the percentage of variation in the data that can be explained by the multiple dimensions?

* (We can do perform PCA for a few different values of d and see which one is best? That requires the point about percentage of variation explained by PCA.)
