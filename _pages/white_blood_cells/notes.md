## Notes to self -- delete later


* Insert visual of plane through three-d data. Great idea would be to use real iris data and show the resulting two-dimensional space.

* Possibly visualize PCA applied to shape space when we build it? Add this to the end of the pca lesson.

* We will lose some information present in the original data, but the more structure that is present in the data, the less information that we will lose. -- something about the percentage of variation in the data that can be explained by the multiple dimensions?

* (We can do perform PCA for a few different values of d and see which one is best? That requires the point about percentage of variation explained by PCA.)

* Need to classify by both family and type to see that not everything is 100 percent perfect

* Try running the algorithm first on every imaginable coordinate. This will be bad.

* Then reduce it down to 10 principal components.

## Tutorials

* Need to explain how to install CellOrganizer

* Save .arff into new step 5 folder?

* Provide completed .arff file

* Provide .zip of full set of tutorials -- and remind students in future tutorials if it is needed
