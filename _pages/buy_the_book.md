We are producing a textbook companion to this course called *Biological Modeling: A Short Tour*, which will be available in spring 2022 in both print and electronic formats. The book will follow the "main text" of the course, while the tutorials --- which may change frequently in the future --- will be hosted on this website.

Publication of the book is being funded via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phillipcompeau/biological-modeling-a-short-tour" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. Our campaign, shown below, is running until January 15, 2022 and has been fully funded, but you can still visit this campaign if you would like to preorder the book as a PDF or in print format.

**Note:** Print copies of the book are only available to backers in North America at this time. If you are outside North America, you can still preorder an electronic copy of the book. If the campaign is successful, we will be providing the book to international markets; please let us know if you'd like to be notified when the book is published by joining our international mailing list at <a href="https://forms.gle/SHQXvjpbPPWKYHuU8" target="_blank">https://forms.gle/SHQXvjpbPPWKYHuU8</a>.
