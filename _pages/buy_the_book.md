## About the book

*Biological Modeling: A Short Tour* offers readers a deep but concise exploration of topics in modeling biological systems at multiple scales. Each chapter poses a single biological question, from why zebras have stripes, to how bacteria explore their world intelligently, to why the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was so effective at binding to human cells. The book then introduces the modeling concepts needed to answer this question. Some talented students at Carnegie Mellon University who helped build the Biological Modeling project appear in the book as chapter co-authors.

*Biological Modeling: A Short Tour* follows the core content of the course, whereas the tutorials powering this core content are hosted on this website.
