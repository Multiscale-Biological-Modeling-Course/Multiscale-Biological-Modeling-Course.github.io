We are producing a textbook companion to this course called *Biological Modeling: A Short Tour*, which will be available in spring 2022 in both print and electronic formats. The book will follow the core content of the course, while the tutorials --- which may change frequently in the future --- will be hosted on this website.

Publication of the book was graciously funded via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/phillipcompeau/biological-modeling-a-short-tour" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.
