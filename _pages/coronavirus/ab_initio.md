## Distributing the work of protein structure prediction around the world

The determination of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein structure was remarkable because in many senses it was a community effort, dividing the computational heavy lifting over thousands of volunteers' computers around the world. Two leading structure prediction projects, [Rosetta@home](https://boinc.bakerlab.org) and [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org), encourage volunteers to download their software and contribute to a gigantic *distributed* effort to predict protein shape. Even with a modest laptop, a user can donate some of their computer's idle resources to contribute to the problem of protein structure prediction. But how does this software work?

Predicting a protein's structure using only its amino acid sequence is called <b><em>ab initio</em> structure prediction</b> (*ab initio* means "from the beginning" in Latin). In this lesson, we will explain a little about how *ab initio* structure prediction algorithms work.

As we dive into structure prediction, we should be more precise about two things. First, we will specify what we mean by the "structure" of a protein. Second, although we know that a polypeptide always folds into the same final three-dimensional shape, we have not said anything about *why* a protein folds in a certain way. We will therefore need a better understanding of how the physicochemical properties of amino acids affect a protein's final structure.

## The four levels of protein structure

Protein structure is a broad term that encapsulates four different levels of description. A protein's **primary structure** refers to the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chain. The primary structure of human hemoglobin subunit alpha can be downloaded <a href="../_pages/coronavirus/files/Human_Hemoglobin_subunit_alpha_Seq.txt" download = "Human_Hemoglobin_subunit_alpha_Seq.txt">here</a>, and the primary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which we showed earlier, can be downloaded <a href="../_pages/coronavirus/files/SARS-CoV-2_spike_seq.txt" download="SARS-CoV-2_spike_seq.txt">here</a>.

A protein's **secondary structure** describes its highly regular, repeating intermediate substructures that form before the overall protein folding process completes. The two most common such substructures, shown in the figure below, are **alpha helices** and **beta sheets**. Alpha helices occur when nearby amino acids wrap around to form a tube structure; beta sheets occur when nearby amino acids line up side-by-side.

A protein's **tertiary structure** describes its final 3D shape after the polypeptide chain has folded and is stable. Throughout this module, when discussing the "shape" or "structure" of a protein, we are almost exclusively referring to its tertiary structure. The figure below shows the tertiary structure of human hemoglobin subunit alpha. For the sake of simplicity, this figure does not show the position of every atom in the protein but rather represents the protein shape as a composition of secondary structures.

{: style="font-size: medium;"}

Finally, some proteins have a **quaternary structure**, which describes the proteinâ€™s interaction with other copies of itself to form a single functional unit, or a **multimer**. Many proteins do not have a quaternary structure and function as an independent monomer. The figure below shows the quaternary structure of hemoglobin, which is a multimer consisting of two alpha subunits and two beta subunits.

As for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein is a **homotrimer**, meaning that it is formed of three essentially identical units called **chains**, each one translated from the corresponding region of the coronavirus's genome. When we talk about identifying the structure of the spike protein in this module, we typically are referring to the structure of a single chain.

The structural units making up proteins are often hierarchical, and the spike protein is no exception. Each spike protein chain is a **dimer**, consisting of two subunits called **S1** and **S2**. Each of these subunits further divides into **protein domains**, distinct structural units within the protein that fold independently and are typically responsible for a specific interaction or function. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a **receptor binding domain (RBD)** located on the S1 subunit of the spike protein that is responsible for interacting with the human ACE2 enzyme; the rest of the protein does not come into contact with ACE2. We will say more about the RBD soon.

## Proteins seek the lowest energy conformation

Now that we know a bit more about how protein structure is defined, we will discuss why proteins fold in a certain way every time. In other words, what are the factors driving nature's magic protein folding algorithm?

Amino acids' variety of side chains causes the amino acids to have different chemical properties, which can lead to different conformations being more chemically "preferable" than others. For example, the table below shows the twenty standard amino acids occurring in proteins grouped by chemical properties. Nine of these amino acids are **hydrophobic** (also called **nonpolar**), meaning that their side chains tend to be repelled by water, and as a result we tend to find these amino acids sheltered from the environment on the interior of the protein.

We can therefore view protein folding as finding the tertiary structure that is the most *stable* given a polypeptide's primary structure. A central theme of the previous module on bacterial chemotaxis was that a system of chemical reactions moves toward equilibrium. The same principle is true of the magic folding algorithm; when a protein folds into its final structure, it is obtaining a conformation that is as chemically stable as possible.

To be more precise, the **potential energy** (sometimes called **free energy**) of a molecule is the energy stored within an object due to its position, state, and arrangement. In molecular mechanics, the potential energy is made up of the sum of **bonded energy** and **non-bonded energy**.

Bonded energy derives from the protein's covalent bonds, as well as the angles of bonds between adjacent amino acids, and the torsion angles that we saw in the [previous lesson](structure_intro), as the protein bends and twists.

Non-bonded energy comprises **electrostatic interactions** and **van der Waals interactions**. Electrostatic interactions refer to the attraction and repulsion force from the electric charge between pairs of charged amino acids. Two of the twenty standard amino acids (arginine and lysine) are positively charged, and two (aspartic acid and glutamic acid) are negatively charged. Two nearby amino acids of opposite charge may interact to form a **salt bridge**. Conformations containing salt bridges, and keeping apart similarly charged amino acids are kept apart, will therefore have lower free energy contributed by electrostatic interactions.

As for van der Waals interactions, atoms are dynamic systems, with electrons constantly buzzing around the nucleus, as shown in the figure below.

{: style="font-size: medium;"}

However, due to random chance, the electrons in an atom could momentarily be unevenly distributed on one side of the nucleus. Because electrons are negatively charged, this uneven distribution will cause the atom to have a temporary negative charge on the side with the excess electrons and a temporary positive charge on the opposite side. As a result of this charge, one side of the atom may attract only the oppositely charged components of another atom, creating an **induced dipole** in that atom in turn as shown in the figure below. Van der Waals forces refer to the attraction and repulsion between atoms because of induced dipoles.

[![image-center](../assets/images/600px/van_der_waals.png){: .align-center}](../assets/images/van_der_waals.png)
Due to random chance, the electrons in the atom on the left have clustered on the left side of the atom, creating a net negative charge on this side of the atom, and therefore a net positive charge on the right side of the atom. This polarity induces a dipole in the atom on the right, whose electrons are attracted because of van der Waals forces.

As the protein folds, it seeks a conformation of *lowest* total potential energy based on all these forces. For a simple analogy, imagine a ball on a slope, as shown in the following figure. Even if the ball bounces around, it will tend to move down the slope. In this analogy, the lower points on the slope correspond to lower energy conformations of a polypeptide.

[![image-center](../assets/images/600px/EnergyCartoon.png){: .align-center}](../assets/images/EnergyCartoon.png)
A ball on a hill offers a classic analogy for a protein folding into the lowest energy structure. As the ball is more likely to move down into a valley, a protein is more likely to fold into a low-energy conformation.

## Modeling *ab initio* structure prediction as an exploration problem

Although a host of different algorithms have been developed for *ab initio* protein structure through the years, these algorithms all find themselves solving a similar problem.

Biochemical research has contributed to the development of scoring functions called **force fields** that compute the potential energy of a candidate protein shape. As a result, for a given choice of force field, we can think of *ab initio* structure prediction as solving the following problem: given a primary structure of a polypeptide, find its tertiary structure having minimum energy. This problem exemplifies an **optimization problem**, in which we look for an object maximizing or minimizing some function subject to constraints.

This formulation of protein structure may not strike you as similar to anything that we have done before in this course. However, consider once more a bacterium exploring an environment for food. Every point in the bacterium's "search space" is characterized by a concentration of attractant at that point, and the bacterium's goal is to reach the point of greatest attractant concentration.

In the case of structure prediction, our search space is the collection of all possible conformations of a given protein. And each point in this search space is characterized by the energy of the conformation at the point. Just as we imagined a ball rolling down a hill to find lower energy, we can now imagine "exploring" the space of all conformations of a polypeptide to find the conformation having lowest energy. This situation is illustrated in the figure below, in which the height of each point represents the energy of the associated conformation; our goal, then, is to find the lowest point in this space.

## A local search algorithm for *ab initio* structure prediction

Now that we have conceptualized finding the most stable protein structure as exploring a search space, our next question is how to develop an algorithm to explore this space. Our idea is to adapt *E. coli*'s clever exploration algorithm from a [previous lesson](../chemotaxis/conclusion) to our purposes. That is, at every step, we need to sense the "direction" in which the energy function decreases by the most, and then move in this direction.

Adapting this exploration algorithm to protein structure prediction requires us to develop a notion of what it means to consider the points "near" a given conformation in a protein search space. Many *ab initio* algorithms will start at an arbitrary initial conformation and then make a variety of minor modifications to that structure (i.e., nearby points in the space), updating the current conformation to the modification that produces the greatest decrease in free energy. These algorithms then iterate the process of changing the protein structure to have greatest decrease in potential energy. We terminate our search when we reach a structure for which no changes to the structure reduce the free energy. Such an approach for structure prediction falls into a broad category of optimization algorithms called **local search algorithms**.

Yet returning to the chemotaxis analogy, imagine what happens if we were to place many small sugar cubes and one large sugar cube into the bacterium's environment. The bacterium will sense the gradient not of the large sugar cube but of its *nearest* attractant. Because the smaller food sources outnumber the larger food source, the bacterium will likely not reach the point of greatest attractant concentration. In terms of bacterial exploration, this is a feature, not a bug; if the bacterium exhausts one food source, then it will just move to another. But in terms of protein structure prediction, we should be worried of winding up in such a **local minimum**, or a protein structure that does not have minimum free energy but does have  the property that no "neighboring" structures have lower energy.

**STOP:** Do you see any ways in which we could improve our local search approach for structure prediction?
{: .notice--primary}

Fortunately, we can modify our local search algorithm in a variety of ways. First, because the initial conformation has a huge influence on the final conformation, we could run the algorithm multiple times with different starting conformations. This is analogous to allowing multiple bacteria to explore their environment at different starting points.

Second, every time we reach a local minimum, we could allow ourselves to change the structure with some probability, thus giving our local search algorithm the chance to "bounce" out of the local minimum. In an approach called **simulated annealing**, we start our local search with this probability high and reduce it over time, so that eventually we will settle into some local minimum that serves as our predicted structure. Once again, randomness helps us solve our problems!

## Applying an *ab initio* algorithm to a protein sequence

To run an *ab initio* structure prediction algorithm on a real protein, we will use a software resource called <a href="https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/QUARK/" target="_blank">QUARK</a>. QUARK is built upon the ideas discussed in the previous section, with some added features. For example, its algorithm applies a combination of *multiple* scoring functions to look for the lowest energy conformation across all of these functions.

Despite the sophistication of software like QUARK, Levinthal's paradox means that the search space of all possible structures for a protein is so large that accurately predicting large protein structures with *ab initio* modeling remains very difficult, and QUARK limits us to proteins with at most 200 amino acids. Since the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains 1281 amino acids, we will instead apply this software to the shorter human hemoglobin subunit alpha.

## Toward a faster approach for protein structure prediction

The figure below shows the top five structures produced by QUARK for human hemoglobin subunit alpha, along with the protein's experimentally verified structure. It takes a keen eye to see any differences between these structures. We conclude that although *ab initio* prediction is slow, it is still able to accurately reconstruct a model of this protein from its amino acid sequence.

{: style="font-size: medium;"}

Yet we also wonder whether we can speed up our structure prediction algorithms so that they will scale to a larger protein like the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In the next lesson, we will learn about another type of protein structure prediction that uses a database of known structures.

**STOP:** What known protein structure(s) would you first want to consult when studying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?
