## Welcome to Biological Modeling!

Have you ever wondered ...
* why zebras have stripes?
* how your cells can perform complex tasks without intelligence?
* why the original SARS coronavirus fizzled out but SARS-CoV-2 spread like wildfire around the planet?
* how algorithms can be trained to “see” as well as a human?

In this free course, we will build models of biological systems that are relatively simple but nevertheless provide us with deep, fascinating insights into how biological systems operate and how to answer these questions.

Our course contents are found below.

## Acknowledgements

This online course is a training and dissemination effort for the <a href="https://mmbios.pitt.edu" target="_blank">National Center for Multiscale Modeling of Biological Systems (MMBioS)</a>. It is supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant ID: P41 GM103712).

We would first and foremost like to thank everyone working on MMBioS software; their work allowed this project to come about. Chiefly, thank you to the other members of our training and dissemination team (Alex Ropelewski, Joe Ayoob, and Rozita Laghaei) as well as the head of the MMBioS consortium, Jim Faeder.

We are also very grateful to Wendy Velasquez Ebanks, Julien Gomez, Yanjing Li, Ulani Qi, Aditya Parekh, and Shalini Panthangi, who provided additional work on the course during its conception.

Module 1 was in part inspired by Uri Alon's research and superlative book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Systems-Biology-Mathematical-Computational/dp/1439837171" target="_blank"><i>An Introduction to Systems Biology</i></a>, a landmark biological textbook that we strongly recommend if you are interested in a greater discussion of biological network motifs.

Special thanks to Jiayi Shou for the analogy in Module 3 of new protein companies rising like "bamboo shoots after the rain".

The cover image on Module 4 was created by Keith Chambers.

Finally, the website design was built using Michael Rose's excellent <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes</a> theme.
