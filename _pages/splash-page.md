    title: "Prologue: Random walks and Turing patterns"
    excerpt: "Have you ever wondered why zebras have stripes? In the course prologue, we’ll explore how simple predator-prey interactions at the microscopic level can give rise to reaction-diffusion systems, where stripes and spots spontaneously emerge from random motion."

    title: "Module 1: Finding motifs in transcription factor networks"
    excerpt: "Transcription factors are proteins that serve as master gene regulators in the cell. When we study how they interact, we uncover remarkable patterns like oscillations that arise from simple behavior. In this module, we will build models to explain why these regulatory patterns have evolved."
