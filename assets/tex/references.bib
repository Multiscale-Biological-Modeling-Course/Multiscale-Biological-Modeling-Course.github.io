  abstract  = "Morphology is an important large-scale manifestation of the
               global organizational and physiological state of cells, and is
               commonly used as a qualitative or quantitative measure of the
               outcome of various assays. Here we evaluate several different
               basic representations of cell shape - binary masks, distance
               maps and polygonal outlines - and different subsequent encodings
               of those representations - Fourier and Zernike decompositions,
               and the principal and independent components analyses - to
               determine which are best at capturing biologically important
               shape variation. We find that principal components analysis of
               two-dimensional shapes represented as outlines provide measures
               of morphology which are quantitative, biologically meaningful,
               human interpretable and work well across a range of cell types
               and parameter settings.",
