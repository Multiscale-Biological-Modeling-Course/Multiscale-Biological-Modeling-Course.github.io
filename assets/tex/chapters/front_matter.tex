%Thank you for joining us!  Since its first publication in 2014, this textbook has become a bestseller in the field of computational biology, having been adopted by dozens of universities in twenty countries (\autopageref{sec:university_adoptions}).  Yet we are equally proud that the textbook also powers our popular online courses in bioinformatics, which have been completed by thousands of learners around the world.  We hope that you will sign up for our courses and explore our material online as well.
%
%You can also find lecture videos, PowerPoint slides, and answers to FAQs at the textbook website, \url{http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.org}.
%
%The subtitle of this book is \textit{An Active Learning Approach}.  This is because as you read, you will find a number of active learning components that will help you learn the material interactively and at your own pace.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item \Black{Code Challenges} ask you to implement the algorithms that you will encounter (in any programming language you like).  These code challenges are hosted in the ``Bioinformatics Textbook Track'' location on Rosalind (\url{http://rosalind.info}), a website that will automatically test your implementations.  \marginpar{\centering\vskip-9ex\includegraphics[width = 3.6em]{images/CMYK_ed3/logos/rosalind}}
%\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
%\item \Blue{Charging Stations} provide additional insights on implementing the algorithms you encounter.  However, we suggest trying to solve a Code Challenge before you visit a Charging Station.\marginpar{\centering\vskip-10.3ex{\includegraphics[width = 3.2em]{images/CMYK_ed3/logos/charging_station_intro}\\ \vskip-8.8ex }}
%%As one of our Coursera students once said, ``read, apply, fail the first attempt, then think carefully about the bigger picture as [you] try to understand why [your] first attempt failed.''
%\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
%\item \Purple{\textbf{Exercise Breaks}} offer ``just in time'' assessments testing your understanding of a topic before moving to the next one.\marginpar{\centering\vskip-6.2ex\includegraphics[width = 3.2em]{images/CMYK_ed3/logos/exercise}}
%\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
%\item \Red{STOP and Think} questions invite you to slow down and contemplate the current material before continuing to the next topic.\marginpar{\centering\vskip-6.1ex\includegraphics[width = 3.2em]{images/CMYK_ed3/logos/stop_sign_no_border}}
%\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
%\item \Orange{Detours} provide extra content that didn't quite fit in the main text.\nop{detour}\marginpar{\centering\vskip-3.3ex\hyperlink{detour}{\includegraphics[width = 6em]{images/CMYK_ed3/logos/detour_blank_no_bg_outline}\hskip-7em\vskip-4.9ex\parbox{7em}{\small\Black{~~~~\textsc{DETOUR}~}}}}
%\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
%\item \Green{Challenge Problems} ask you to apply what you have learned to real experimental datasets.
%\item \Yellow{FAQs} \marginpar{\centering\vskip-4.6ex\includegraphics[width = 3.6em]{images/CMYK_ed3/logos/faq}} are questions that we encountered many times from the learners who have taken our online courses and the students we have taught using this book in our own offline courses.  When you see the question mark symbol in the margin, it indicates that there is an FAQ on the current subject; answers to FAQs are hosted at the textbook website.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\noindent Finally, we have tried to make the book as fun to read as possible.  For example, since bioinformatics is still an ever-changing frontier, we decided to implement a Wild West theme for the book. Accordingly, you will notice that each chapter begins with a cartoon image showing the authors entangled in some adventure. What do these cartoons have to do with bioinformatics?  Continue reading to find out!

%\noindent This textbook was greatly improved by the efforts of a large number of individuals, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude.
%
%The development team, as well as Laurence Bernstein, Ksenia Krasheninnikova, Max Shen, and Jeffrey Yuan, implemented coding challenges and exercises, rendered figures, helped typeset the text, and offered insightful feedback on the manuscript.
%
%Glenn Tesler provided thorough chapter reviews and even implemented some software to catch errors in the early version of the manuscript!
%
%Robin Betz, Petar Ivanov, James Jensen, and Yu Lin provided insightful comments on the manuscript in its early stages. David Robinson was kind enough to copy edit a few chapters and palliate our punctuation maladies.
%
%Randall Christopher brought to life our crazy ideas for illustrations throughout the book, including the chapter header cartoons and the textbook cover.
%
%Andrey Grigoriev and Max Alekseyev gave advice on the content of \autoref{chapter:replication} and \autoref{chapter:rearrangements}, respectively. Martin Tompa helped us develop the narrative in \autoref{chapter:motifs} by suggesting that we analyze latent tuberculosis infection.
%
%Nikolay Vyahhi led a team composed of Andrey Balandin, Artem Suschev, Aleksey Kladov, and Kirill Shikhanov, who worked hard to support an online, interactive version of this textbook used in our online courses on Coursera.
%
%Our students on Coursera, especially Mark Mammel, Isabel Lupiani, Erika Ram\'irez and Dmitry Kuzminov, found hundreds of typos in our preliminary manuscript.
%
%Mikhail Gelfand, Uri Keich, Hosein Mohimani, Son Pham, and Glenn Tesler advised us on some of the book's ``Open Problems'' and led Massive Open Online Research projects (MOORs) in the first session of our online course.
%
%The Big Data to Knowledge Program at the National Institutes of Health, as well as Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Russian Ministry of Education and Science generously gave their support for the development of the online courses accompanying this textbook.  The Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Program and the Computer Science \& Engineering Department at the University of California, San Diego provided additional support.
%
%Finally, our families gracefully endured the many long days and nights that we spent poring over manuscripts over the last several years; they helped us preserve our sanity along the way.
