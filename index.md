## Welcome!

Welcome to *Biological Modeling*!

Have you ever wondered why zebras have stripes? Have you ever wondered how your cells can quickly react to their environment and perform complex tasks without intelligence? Have you ever wondered why the original SARS coronavirus fizzled out but SARS-CoV-2 has spread like wildfire around the planet? Have you ever wondered how  algorithms can be trained to “see” cells as well as a human?

What these questions share is that they can start to be answered by modeling biological systems at multiple "scales" of resolution, from the microscopic to the molecular.

In this free course, we will build models of biological systems that are relatively simple but nevertheless provide us with deep, fascinating insights into how those systems operate.

## Course structure and contents

This online course is divided into a prologue and four main modules. Each of the five parts of the book covers a single biological topic (e.g., "Analyzing the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein") and introduces all of the modeling topics needed to address that topic from first principles. The modules build on each other, so we suggest covering them in order, although it is possible to complete them out of order.

Each module has a main narrative that can be explored by anyone, including beginner modelers; this main narrative will form our upcoming book. When we need to build a model along the way, we pass our modeling work to "software tutorials" that show how to use high-powered modeling software produced by <a href="http://mmbios.pitt.edu" target="_blank">MMBioS</a> researchers to build biological models. The software tutorials allow users wishing to get their hands dirty with modeling software to build all of the models that we need in this course. This allows for a course that can be explored by both casual and serious biological modeling learners alike.

After building a model in a software tutorial, we will return to the main text and analyze the results of this model. In this way, the text forms a constant interplay between establishing a biological problem, describing how a model work, implementing that model in a software tutorial, and returning to the text to analyze the model and ask our next question, beginning the cycle anew.
