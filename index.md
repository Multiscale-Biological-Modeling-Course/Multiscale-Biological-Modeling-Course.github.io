## Welcome to our course!

Welcome to our free and open course in multiscale biological modeling!

That may seem like a mouthful. By "biological modeling" we mean that we are going to build models of biological systems that are relatively simple but nevertheless provide us with some deep insights into how those systems operate.

Furthermore, we will perform modeling of molecular and cellular biological systems at multiple "scales" of resolution, from the study of a single protein molecule within a cell's cytoplasm, to observing the interaction of proteins molecules interacting with each other as a whole, to a much wider view that considers cells themselves interacting with each other.  There are fascinating insights lurking at all these levels of resolution, and the goal of this course is to help learners understand some approaches that lead us to these insights.

Have you ever wondered what process causes zebras to have stripes? Have you ever wondered how your cells can react to their environment and perform complex tasks without any intelligence guiding them? Have you wondered why the original SARS coronavirus did not become a pandemic in 2003 but SARS-CoV-2 has spread like wildfire through the population? Have you ever wondered how automated algorithms can be trained that can "see" cells as well as a human?

These are the questions -- and more! -- that we will address in this course. We will see that each of them can be answered using modeling.

1. Make sure to refer your students to our website.

2. Get in touch with us using our [contact](contact) form so that we can add you to our list of adopting instructors and provide you with updates about the project in the future. We plan to build a community of instructors adopting this course.

## Meet the team

This course was lovingly put together by a professor and a team of superlative students in Carnegie Mellon University's [Computational Biology Department](http://cbd.cmu.edu), one of seven departments within CMU's School of Computer Science. You can meet us on our [Meet the Team](meet-the-team) page.
